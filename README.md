# Neural Ordinary Differential Equations

This repository showcases a basic implementation of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), a groundbreaking [concept](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366) by Chen et. al that introduces a novel family of neural networks.

## Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs)

Welcome to the Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) repository! Here, we delve into the fascinating realm of Neural ODEs, a revolutionary concept introduced by Chen et al. that reimagines neural networks through the lens of ordinary differential equations. This repository serves as a small guide to understanding, implementing, and experimenting with Neural ODEs.

### What are Neural Ordinary Differential Equations?

Neural ODEs are a groundbreaking approach that challenges the traditional architecture of neural networks. Instead of the conventional stacked layers of neurons, Neural ODEs harness the power of differential equations to model hidden layers. This not only leads to elegant and flexible architectures but also provides a deeper mathematical understanding of neural networks' dynamics. The core idea behind Neural ODEs is the use of continuous-depth models. In a standard neural network, data is processed layer by layer, with each layer applying a specific transformation. Neural ODEs, on the other hand, treat the transformation between layers as a continuous process governed by ordinary differential equations. This means that the network's hidden states evolve continuously, allowing for a more natural representation of dynamic systems.
