# Neural Ordinary Differential Equations

This repository showcases an implementation of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), a groundbreaking [concept](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366) by Ricky T. Q. et. al that introduces a novel family of neural networks. In this approach, certain hidden layers, and in some cases, even the sole layer, are implemented using an ordinary differential equation solver.
